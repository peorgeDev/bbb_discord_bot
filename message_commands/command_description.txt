Commands in this folder will all be loaded at the startup of the bot (subject to change), and are expected to export an object with the following format:
{
	trigger: "a trigger for the command, should start with a '!' barring special cases"
	handler: "a function that will take in the entire message object, the return type should be void (subject to change)"
}
